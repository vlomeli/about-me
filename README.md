# Hello I'm Victor Lomeli-Ponce
I am from a small town in the central valley.
Something I enjoy doing is learning new things.
Currently a web developer intern @ digitalNEST. 
At the moment I am utilizing the MERN stack and Wordpress & PHP.
The techs that have used in past projects are html, css, js, python, react, mongodb, sql.
My goal is to become a full-stack software engineer.
